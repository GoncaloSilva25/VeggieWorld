# VeggieWorld
VeggieWorld is a mobile app designed for parents to track and monitor a child's vegetable consumption.
This project was developed in the course "Introduction to Human-Interaction" where the main focus were the cyclical process of development and the importance of user-testing. 
From this project I learned how crucial the early phases of planning, testing and developing are important in order to produce code in a cheaper, faster and consistent way.
